# gardenMonitor

A simple web application for monitoring metrics around a hydroponic garden I'm working on.
Its built on top of [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) and features a policy restricted backend for submitting new data.
Currently it works in tandem with a script I have running on a raspberry pi with sensors which collect the data monitored here.
The graphs are drawn using an express version of NVD3.
